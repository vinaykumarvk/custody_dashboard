## 1. Executive Summary
This Business Requirements Document (BRD) outlines the requirements for developing an Operations Dashboard for Operation Heads and Global Heads within the organization. The dashboard aims to provide real-time monitoring of operational metrics, alerts, and business intelligence to facilitate informed decision-making and effective operations management.

The Operations Dashboard will consolidate data from various operational systems to provide a comprehensive view of key business metrics and operational status. It will include different views tailored to the specific needs of Operation Heads and Custody Operation Heads, with a focus on client data, trade volumes, corporate actions, billing, payments, and customer service indicators.
